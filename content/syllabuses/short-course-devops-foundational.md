### Group session structure
We will have two 1h group sessions per week. They will mostly follow the structure below:

- Chat about tasks and questions from last week
- Conceptual session: the learners will be broken into groups and given a conceptual question or problem to work on for a specific amount of time. Once the time is up, the learners will be brought back to the main room and present their solutions.

The week's tasks and quizzes must be sent by latest on Sunday.
