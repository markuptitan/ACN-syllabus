robotic-process-automation/introduction

There are lots and lots of different commercial RPA tools out there. There are a lot of pretty shiney tools out there that do a lot of work for you under the hood. But we'll be using open-source coding tools to do RPA. There area a few reasons for this.

The main reason is that pure code-based RPA systems are a LOT more powerful then RPA systems that force a user to use a user interface
- if a process is specified i code, it is more reusable and debuggable
- you can make use of tools like Git to allow safe collaboration on your processes
- if you can code it, you can include it in your apa processes. This means you can use whatever 3rd party services you can get your hands on
- you can test your stuff
- your knowledge is transferrable. This is a big one!

The hard part of automation is not learning a specific tool or user interface, the hard part is:

1. Understanding what's happening under the hood
2. Knowing what to automate
3. How to stop the robots from taking your job. Just kidding. Sortof.

TagUI is an open source and free to use RPA tool that is great for web automations. TagUI is maintained by AI Singapore, a Singapore government-funded initiative to build local Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities.
