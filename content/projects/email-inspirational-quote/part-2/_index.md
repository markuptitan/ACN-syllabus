Upgrade your project so that it fetches quotes from the API described here:
https://favqs.com/api/ 

Please use the "Quote of the Day" endpoint since it doesn't require tokens or authentication, making it easier for end users to test your application.

## Tests

As usual, test your work well. You will need to make sure that you are using mocks/spies to test this work.
