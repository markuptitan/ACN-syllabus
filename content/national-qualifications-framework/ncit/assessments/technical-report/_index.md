Create a technical report based on your "Design Thinking Sprint" (DTS) or your "Make Us Better" (MUB) on [THIS TEMPLATE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ww1Y9KEKQZS3EOTKcl4aQ__ockq3FSD7/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=106698657596806218419&rtpof=true&sd=true) to fulfil the research and technical report requirements.

If you did not attend the above or no longer have access to your project you will need to conduct research on game design. 

Ensure this document meets the standards and criteria in {{< contentlink path="national-qualifications-framework/ncit/content/write-a-report" >}}

Required format: Google Doc

Upload the document to google drive and submit a link. Ensure that the submission has the `docx` file extension. Please make sure that the link works. If your work is private then we won't be able to review it. You can double-check this by opening your own link in an incognito browser.  

Your link should look something like this:
