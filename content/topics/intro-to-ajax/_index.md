Ajax, short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, revolutionized web development by enabling seamless asynchronous communication between a web application's frontend and server. This technology allows specific parts of a webpage to be updated dynamically without requiring a complete refresh, resulting in faster and more responsive user experiences. By utilizing JavaScript to send and receive data in the background, Ajax has significantly contributed to the interactivity and real-time capabilities of modern web applications.
