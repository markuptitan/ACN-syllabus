### What is Typescript

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds types as well as other language features.
- Typescript was created to make it easier to write code that is compatible with the JavaScript language.
- Strong static typing, compilation, and object-oriented programming are all features of TypeScript that has made it a popular language.

#### The TypeScript Transpiler

- TypeScript must be transpiled into JavaScript for execution, the code gets transpiled to JavaScript by the TypeScript Transpiler.
- The TypeScript transpiler “tsc” transpile TypeScript programmes into JavaScript programmes and in the process analyses them and reports type errors.

##### To learn more about TypeScript and the TypeScript Transpiler read the following content

- [TypeScript Transpiler](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling)
- [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/)

As usual, the official docs say it best :)

Take note of that fact: IF you want to learn something new then the official documentation usually has the best and most up to date tutorial. This isn't always the case, but it's always a great place to look.

Start here: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html
Familiarise yourself with the entire handbook. Start from the top.

Since you are already a coder it should all feel very familiar.
