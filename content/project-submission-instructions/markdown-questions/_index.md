title: How to submit your markdown files

Create one file per question. Name your files like so:

```
question_1.md
question_2.md
question_3.md
...etc
```

You can just upload these files into the main branch of your repo. There is no need to make pull requests for this project.

The questions should be in the root directory of your repository! If you make extra directories you will be asked to resubmit your work. 

## Each file should have the following format

Each file should look like this:

```
# Question

The question goes here. Take note of the heading above.

# Answer

Your answer goes here
```

For example, if the question was "What are all the colors of the rainbow?"

Then your file should look like this:

```
# Question

What are all the colors of the rainbow?

# Answer 

The colors of the rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
```

## If you are new to Github and need some help submitting your work

Follow [this  guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) to upload your files to your repo.

The guide might have a few confusing words. I'll define them briefly here:

- commit: Every time you make a change to your code on Github, then Github will keep track of what changed. You'll forever have access to every version of your code. Commit is just a special word for version. 
- commit message: Every time you make a new version of your code you're making a commit. Every commit can have a message. That way when you look over your version history you can see what you did when. This gets useful on big projects or when you are working on a team because you will be able to see the whole history of the project.

You'll be asked if you want to add your code to the main branch or if you want to create a new branch. Branches are cool, trust me, but we aren't going to get into them right now.  Just choose "main branch" 

Once you have filled in the form you can save your changes by clicking on the "commit" button.

## If you are not new to github

Please use Git from the command line. Commit early and often.

## IMPORTANT

It is critical that you use your own words when answering written assignments. If you copy-paste from the Internet or your peers then that means:

- you will not absorb the lessons you ned to absorb
- we will consider you unprofessional and that means your options will be limited and you will get less support
